# smart_search_engine🧨😎
A search engine that allows you to search within a dataset of files and return results as quickly as possible and with high accuracy
The engine is a web page built using html and ajax that contains an input field and the results appear in the form of a text address and an id
Requests are processed and results are returned via code written in Python
The project was built based on the MVC principle, where:😴
- 🧨The dataset is processed and loaded through the load dataset folder, which represents the model
- 🤜The interface code is built into the screens folder
- 😍The requests are processed through the controller and it sends the corresponding data from the model to the screen
The project, like other search engines, consists of an offline phase in which the data is processed and prepared to answer user inquiries, and an online phase in which the query is received and processed and a matching procedure is performed to return the corresponding data
Here are some pictures of the interface ❤🤛:
